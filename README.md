I'll create a README.md for your healthcare EMR system project using the same format as the lung cancer risk factor analysis project:

# Healthcare EMR System: Streamlining Data Management

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code, database schema, and documentation for a comprehensive Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system. The project implements a full-stack solution with React frontend, Node.js middleware, and MySQL database backend to optimize patient registration, appointment scheduling, and clinical documentation workflows. This work was completed as part of a capstone project at GTECHNOLOGIES PTY LTD in collaboration with Indiana University's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering.

## Team Members
* Lavanya Ranganatham (Developer)
* Dr. Zeyana Hamid (Academic Advisor)
* Rajeshwar Reddy Konkisa (Project Preceptor)

## Project Aims
1. Build a secure, functional EMR patient registration system
2. Ensure data accuracy and integrity through validation mechanisms
3. Design database structures that support future AI integration capabilities
4. Improve healthcare workflow efficiency through intuitive user interfaces
5. Establish foundation for future AI-enhanced health analytics

## Repository Structure
* `client/`: React frontend application with components for all system modules
* `server/`: Node.js Express server providing API endpoints for the application
* `database/`: SQL schema containing the comprehensive database design
* `docs/`: Documentation including project overview and technical specifications

## System Features
The EMR system includes several integrated modules:
* **Patient Registration**: Comprehensive patient demographic and contact information
* **Appointment Booking**: Scheduling with doctor availability checking
* **Medical History**: Documentation of patient health background
* **Laboratory Results**: Storage and retrieval of test results
* **Diagnosis & Treatment**: Clinical documentation workflow
* **Medication Management**: Prescription tracking with interaction warnings

## Methodology
The project follows a full-stack development approach:
1. **Database Design**: MySQL schema with 100+ tables covering all healthcare data domains
2. **Server Development**: Node.js middleware connecting frontend to database
3. **Frontend Implementation**: React components with modern dark-themed UI
4. **Integration**: Connecting all system components with comprehensive API
5. **Testing**: Validation and functional testing of complete system

## Key Implementations
* **Comprehensive Database Schema**: Multiple interconnected tables for complete patient data
* **Secure Authentication**: User management with role-based access control
* **Form Validation**: Client and server-side validation to ensure data integrity
* **Responsive Design**: Modern dark-themed UI optimized for all devices
* **Performance Optimization**: Efficient database queries and frontend rendering

## Technology Stack
* **Frontend**: React 19.1.0, CSS for styling
* **Backend**: Node.js with Express
* **Database**: MySQL for robust data storage
* **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Command Prompt

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Set up the MySQL database using the schema in `database/schema.sql`
3. Install server dependencies and start the server:
   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
4. Install client dependencies and start the React application:
   ```
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Dependencies
* React.js 19.1.0+
* Node.js 16.0.0+
* MySQL 8.0+
